# Datasets
Datasets generated within the data collection and analysis systems

## Events

Events are sent for analysis as they happen

- [New Domain Event](NewDomainEvent.md) are events from Edge when a domain is new locally

## Reports

Reports are collections of data that are sent for analysis at timed intervals

- [Histogram](HistogramReport.md) are raw histograms generated by Edge
- [Wellknown Domain Histogram](WellknownHistogramReport.md) are aggregated histograms generated by Core

## Vectors

Vectors are encoded sequences of queries

- [Query Vector](future/QueryVector.md) are vectorized query information from Edge - Work in progress

## Sets

Sets are, in essence, lookup tables. These are generally viewed as either _known good_ or _known bad_ baselines, but without actual ground truth the nominations are more correctly described as _probably good_ or _probably bad_. Note that sets are not necessarily implemented as separate tables, and can very well be a unified lookup table with multiple sets.

#### Known good

- [Wellknown Domains](WellknownDomainsSet.md)
- [Previously Seen](PreviouslySeenSet.md)

#### Known bad

- [Suspect Domains](future/SuspectDomainSet.md) - Work in progress
- [Suspect Clients](future/SuspectClientSet.md) - Work in progress
- [Suspect Nameservers](future/SuspectServersSet.md) - Work in progress
- [Suspect Response Address](future/SuspectResponseAddressSet.md) - Work in progress


## Transformations

Transformations is the process that transforms one dataset into a different dataset, typically for the purpose of feature extraction, aggregation and/or privacy enhancement.

- [Pseudonymization](PseudonymizationTransform.md)

## Filters

Filters primarily serve to minimize data by removing uninteresting data or noise. These filters act on the collected data and are different from filters acting on the DNS query-response process.

- [IngressMinimization](IngressMinimizationFilter.md)

## Notifications

Notifications are publicized domains that pass a threshold. There may be multiple thresholds signifying an estimation of reliability or risk. 

- [Observation Event (aggregated)](AggregatedObservations.md) are events sent from Core with aggregated observations ( ≤ 32 tags )
- [Observation Events (detailed)](future/DetailedObservations.md) are events with full tag information ( ∞ tags )
