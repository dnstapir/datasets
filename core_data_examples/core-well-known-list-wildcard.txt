# Subdomain trees that are known and should be aggregated at Edge
# This is not a statement on the quality of the domain, merely
# indicates a previously known domain 
# Mainly used by Edge DNSTAP minimiser (EDM)
# Names are matched by suffix (right-anchored)
#
# Important note:
#
# Domains that are aggregated as wildcards will be summarised under
# that label, so by wildcarding "example.com" will result in all 
# features extracted by EDM being aggregated under that domain, eg
#
# example.com, <all A-queries>, <all AAAA-queries>, etc.
#
# Domains aggregated in this way will have the wildcard flag set
# in the EDM histogram report. If there also exists an entry for 
# exactly matching example.com, there will be two entries.
# 
#
# A test set based a list of names can be generated as follows:
#
#  tapir-cli --standalone dawg compile --format text --src wellknownwildcards.txt --dawg out.dawg
#
# The names need to have a dot prepended to be seen as wildcards, so
# the wildcard string for "example.com." would be ".example.com."
#
google.com.
facebook.com.
